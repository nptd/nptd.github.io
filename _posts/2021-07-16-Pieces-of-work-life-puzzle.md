It has been about a month since I completed my 10 years at Intel. To be very honest, I had never thought I would spend that much amount of time working for a single employer! That being said, it was a great moment to reflect back on my journey at Intel over the past decade. It lead to a bigger question on why is one happy at a workplace, what are the different components which leads to people feeling cherished and productive, how can leaders and individuals create spaces which help rub the enthusiasm and goodwill on colleagues? For every employee the experience of joy is different because it depends on individual wants and needs! [^1] As an engineer at heart, I felt the need to dissect more into this. So here are my views on it. 

These are some of the vectors which make people happy at workplace. These are in no order of importance. I would like to share my experiences and views attached toeach of them.  

1. Money   

    Let's get this out of the way. We need money to meet the basic needs. If the employees are paid well, they will stay. At the end of the day, that is one of the biggest motivators for some people to move out of the company. It is disheartening to see that your peers at other companies get paid more for the same role and job you are doing. I do strongly believe in meritocracy. There is no free lunch. I do believe that employees need to be paid for the quality of job. I also believe stale, outdated compensation practices do hurt the company and its employees the most.  

2. Responsibilities   
    
    While hiring the right candidate from external teams or companies is important, it is important to know the value of home-grown players. Take soccer team Barcelona, for example. A lot of their team players graduate from their youth club - La Masia. Empowering current employeesto take on new roles, wear new hats, try new things, accept the failures but laud the effort should be part of the team culture. I feel the fun begins when you are delegated a responsibility where you can bring in your skill to deliver it, but it has the right amount of stretch to get the job done. I feel it is that stretch which motivates you to keep going. I have been fortunate in all my years at Intel to work on so many stretch responsibilities. It has helped me take new challenges, learn new domains (firmware to deep learning, embedded todistributed computing, CPUs to FPGAs!), keep myself motivated to come back towork every day - because at the end of the day I know I will be able to stretch some more! 

3. Work Life Balance   

    Everyone is in a different phase of life. I learned this while I was navigating through my life at Intel as well. Starting off at Intel, I was in a newly married stage of my personal life. Fewer responsibilities, my life revolved around work. My spouse and I loved to travel. So, our energies were focused on trip planning, which did not inherently conflict with work. I was able to contribute and was able to shoot for far more demanding role and schedule. As I moved in the next phase of my life and had 2 little kids, I did view things from a different lens. There was more need for coordination with my working spouse to pick kids from day care, stay at home while my kids were sick, driving them to doctors. This in fact changed the way I worked and my managers being supportive of these life changing phases! Behold I made sure my deliverables did not slip, but it was comforting to be able to talk with my managers and peers about the life experiences openly. It was always reassuring to hear the supportive voices. 

4. Team   
    
    In my opinion, Team in fact trumps Money on why people are happy at workplace. You spend at least - 8 hours/day, 40hours/week, 2080 hours/year - interacting with people in your team. While you gravitate naturally to a set of people who you think you gel with, it is important to understand that the same collective set of people in that team did not exist in the first place. They were hired for a job, but their lives are also intertwined. It is so important to hand pick the hires and have a cultural fit (beside the technical fit obviously) for a role! From my personal experience, I can vouch how demotivating it could be to be in a team where you are the odd fitting piece of that puzzle. I personally, while interviewing take special interest in viewing if a person not only is a technical fit for the role, but also a cultural fit for the team.  

Looking back and trying to recollect all the leadership talks - they talk about building great teams. Great teams and joyful, happy workplaces go hand in hand. At times, I do feel lost and having that network of safe space to talk with peers and mentors puts things to perspective. After all, I work at this unique company in the world where we push physics to the edge, developproducts to solve difficult problems, touch people's life every day and put asmile on their face. That makes me happy, what about you?
