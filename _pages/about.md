My journey in engineering began with a deep-seated curiosity for electronics, culminating in a B.E. in Electronics Engineering. Early on, I honed my skills at Siemens, automating processes for large-scale industrial plants. Despite a passion for computers, my focus shifted towards Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), prompting me to pursue an M.S. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Analog and Mixed Signal design.

My journey has been a tapestry woven with diverse threads of learning and growth. From FPGAs to GPUs, from firmware to AI/ML. I have worked on low level simulations to developing code for supercomputers. I've had the privilege of leading teams through complex projects, from inception and Proof of Concepts to their successful integration into market-ready solutions. These experiences have not only shaped my professional growth but also underscored the importance of collaboration and mentorship in achieving milestones.
